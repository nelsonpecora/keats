# The new Keats.me

This is the repo for my redesigned website (October 2013 y'all!). I separated it from my [blog](http://blog.keats.me), and will mostly just have static content here. I'm building some cool stuff for it, and I'll be able to play around with some of the newest tech without worrying about compatability stuff.

## Layout

* Homepage - a good splash page is still useful, even in the post-post-modern web.
* Blog - maybe I'll actually post stuff in a reasonable timeframe. maybe.
* Projects - a portfolio of projects I've worked on, both client work and personal stuff.
* Resume - I want to experiment with different portrayals of "resume" information, since the web is much more flexible than a black+white printed piece of paper.
* That's it! - personal websites should be lean and mean.
